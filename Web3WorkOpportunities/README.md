## 英文寒暄
+ Interviewer: Hello, I'm Tracy. Thanks so much for coming in.
+ Jane (Interviewee): It's my pleasure, thank you so much for meeting with me.
+ Interviewer: Have a seat, please. Jane, how are you doing?
+ Jane (Interviewee): I'm doing really well. It's such a nice day out there. 
+ Interviewer: Yes, it is. It was perfect weather all the weekend. Oh, can I have your resume（简历）? Jane, now tell me a little about yourself.
+ Jane (Interviewee): I studied tourism management in Fudan University. Last year, I graduated and got my bachelor degree with GPA ranking first. Then I made up my mind to further my study. So, now I’m a graduate student in the same major and same school. In my senior year, I worked in Ctrip as a marketing intern. During that time, I ran a social media account on my own, and got thousands of fans in just a month. I also started a co-branding project from scratch. Because of this work, I’ve earned a lot of experience in communication and how to learn things in a short time. Now I am looking for new opportunities and I’m really honored to be here today.
